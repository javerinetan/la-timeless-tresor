## Scope

Our team was tasked with creating an interactive prototype of a hotel website utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each team member was assigned to design and develop one content-rich webpage and one interactive webpage, which would include an online form.

## What is Le Timeless Tresor ?

The name "Tresor" is a combination of English and French, with "tresor" translating to "treasure" in English. We chose this name as it represents the precious memories that guests will create during their stay at our resort.

The design of the resort website was based on the feedback from a user survey. The survey revealed that 95.7% of respondents preferred a monochromatic color scheme and 87% chose a brown color template.

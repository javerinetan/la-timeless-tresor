## Scope
Our team has been assigned to design and develop an interactive prototype of a hotel website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each team member is responsible for creating one content-rich webpage and one interactive online form webpage.

## What is Le Timeless Tresor ?
The name is a mix of english and french, with tresor translating to treasure. 
We chose this name as we want the memories that our guests make at our resort to be a timeless treasure for them. 
The resort website was designed based on our user survey where 95.7% and 87% of our respondents chose a monochromatic scheme and a brown colour template respectively.

- Based on our goal for Le Timeless Trésor, we build a system along with the logo. 
   - The logo was designed by the inspiration of creating a icon to represent treasure of the time of our visiotors.

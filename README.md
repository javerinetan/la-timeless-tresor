## Scope
Our team has been assigned to design and develop an interactive prototype of a hotel website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each team member is responsible for creating one content-rich webpage and one interactive online form webpage.

## What is Le Timeless Tresor ?
The name is a mix of english and french, with tresor translating to treasure. 
We chose this name as we want the memories that our guests make at our resort to be a timeless treasure for them. 
The resort website was designed based on our user survey where 95.7% and 87% of our respondents chose a monochromatic scheme and a brown colour template respectively.

- Based on our goal for Le Timeless Trésor, we build a system along with the logo. 
   - The logo was designed by the inspiration of creating a icon to represent treasure of the time of our visiotors.
  
- Color scheme template we use for our hotel website:
   - These colors were choosen base on the idea of creating a luxury feel and minimalist hotel.

🔨<i> Protoyping by skecthing and on Pencil app </i>
 
 Next was the prototyping stage where designed the different pages by sketching and using the pencil app to improve the design quality. I took into consideration user experience and easy navigation. Defining the features I wanted on the site, which was to ensure that the users will be able to get the information they want presented in a nice and organised manner.
 
 Sketched Prototype:

When sketching the prototype, I created pop up visuals to represent the buttons and drop down menu. This allows me to better visualise if my design was easy to use and navigate around.

 👩‍💻<i> Development </i>
Once all our sketches was approved by each member, we started developing our website using HTML and CSS. Our leader Damian created a GitHub repository to help us intergrate our project together. 
I started by creating the about us page first as it was a lot of content . This was my first time using HTML and CSS to code a website. It was a learning experience as I watched and learned from online website how to code different parts of website.
